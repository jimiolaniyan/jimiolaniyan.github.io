    <p>During my third year as an undergraduate, something spectacular happened; the school management installed free WiFi
in the hostel where I resided. It was unbelievable. I spent several hours everyday doing the things I loved the most on
the internet: reading Quora (I had an obsession back then), downloading the latest movies (not anymore), and of course,
downloading programming videos from youtube channels. At this point, I can only remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston">thenewboston</a>
but there were several others. Of course, as with anything that comes free, people tend to be excessive.</p>

<p>I was what you would call a <strong>bandwidth thug</strong> which roughly means someone who takes from the internet and doesn&rsquo;t
contribute to it. Unfortunately, after all these years, I don&rsquo;t think I have dropped this title. There was a period when
actively tried to make sure I contribute something meaningful to the programming community. I tried to be active on
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2826013/jimi">stackoverflow</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2826013/jimi?tab=questions">asking</a>
and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2826013/jimi?tab=answers">answering</a> as many questions as I could at the time. Going
by how much I had learnt from people who made their content free and accessible for anyone with an internet connection,
I knew had to contribute as well. I still do.</p>

<p>I understand there are several ways to contribute these days (open source, Q&amp;A, blogging etc.) I haven&rsquo;t made much use of
them since those years when I stopped being active on stackoverflow. Therefore, once again I am making a commitment to
contribute to the internet and I have chosen blogging as a means (at least for now).</p>
